    <p>Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, 
        transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly 
        colorless chemical substance, which is the main 
        constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids 
        of all known living organisms (in which it acts as 
        a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of 
        life, despite providing neither food, energy, nor 
        organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, 
        indicates that each of its molecules contains one 
        oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by 
        covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to 
        the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°.[2] "Water" 
        is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at 
        standard temperature and pressure. <a href=
